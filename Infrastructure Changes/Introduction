**1. Introduction**

In the rapidly evolving landscape of healthcare technology, the migration to cloud infrastructure has become imperative for organizations aiming to enhance operational efficiency, scalability, and accessibility. However, the transformative shift to the cloud also brings forth a heightened focus on security considerations, especially when dealing with sensitive patient data. This final project report encapsulates the culmination of our group's in-depth assessment of a healthcare company's cloud infrastructure, aiming to fortify its security posture.

Our initial endeavor, as outlined in the midterm submission, delved into a meticulous examination of security vulnerabilities within the existing cloud environment. Building upon those insights, this report transitions into a comprehensive overview of recommended infrastructure changes and the strategic deployment of services and methodologies to mitigate identified risks.

**1.1 Infrastructure Changes Overview**

Our proposed changes encapsulate a holistic approach, encompassing architectural enhancements and the adoption of advanced cloud services and tools. A key facet of this transformation is the construction of a robust application stack, comprising web servers, application servers, and database servers. Each component is intricately designed to serve distinct functions, ensuring a seamless and secure flow of information.

**1.2 Proposed Scenarios**

Our architectural paradigm revolves around three pivotal scenarios, each catering to different user perspectives:

- **Patient's Point of View**: Emphasizing user-friendly access, patients can seamlessly navigate the portal from personal devices, engaging in telemedicine consultations, accessing test results, scheduling appointments, and making general inquiries.
- **Care Provider's Point of View**: Care providers are granted comprehensive access to patient data and the ability to exchange critical information with third parties, including hospitals. This scenario underscores the need for secure and efficient data management.
- **IT Support's Point of View**: The IT support team, playing multifaceted roles encompassing end-user support, database administration, system administration, and super admin functions, requires a streamlined interface for efficient infrastructure management.

1.3 Technical Overview and Mitigation Strategies

Our proposed architecture harnesses the capabilities of a leading cloud service provider, ensuring a robust foundation for hosting healthcare applications. The data storage infrastructure, comprising cloud-based databases and file storage systems, is strategically designed to secure patient records and medical images. Virtual Machines (VMs) play a pivotal role in hosting applications and databases, with meticulous attention given to network configuration and Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.

Mitigating identified risks involves a multifaceted approach, incorporating automated assignment of public and private IP addresses, robust IAM controls, and a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) designed for scalability and future growth. The proposed architecture aligns with industry best practices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of healthcare data, fostering a secure and resilient cloud environment. Accompanying this report is a detailed architectural diagram that intricately illustrates the proposed changes, capturing the essence of our strategic approach in mitigating security vulnerabilities within the healthcare company's cloud infrastructure.
